# Event-Calendar-Website

The event calendar is a website which allows the students/faculty/staff to keep a track of all the upcoming events, orientations etc. It integrates the event details of various clubs onto a single platform. The students hence need not keep track of each of these club activities individually, they can simply tune to the Event Calendar website. The calendar contents are handled by the respective club/group Representatives, who are provided with a unique login identity by the admin. The club Representatives can view, add, update and delete the event details as per requirements.
